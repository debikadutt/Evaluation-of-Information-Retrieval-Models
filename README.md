# Evaluation-of-Information-Retrieval-Models

-	Experimented the JSON data retrieved from Twitter by implementing different information retrieval models like Vector Space Model, BM25SimilarityFactory Model and LMDirichletFactory Model based on Solr that gives the best result on the set of queries using TREC_eval program.
-	Improved the performance of the system or the scoring mechanism on measures such as MAP, F-measure, nDCG and BPREF that ranks retrieved documents using different score boosting techniques of Solr by using advanced query processing techniques such as query expansion and using a different query parser.
